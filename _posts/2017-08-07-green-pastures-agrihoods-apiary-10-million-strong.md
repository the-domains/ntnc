Aromatic Herbs - coriander, catnip, mint, parsley, lavender/_Lavandula, _mint_/Mentha, _sage/_Salvia_.

Annuals - marigolds, phlox, bachelor's button, zinnia, _cosmos_, salvia.

Perennials - bergamot bee balm/_Monarda_, Shasta daisy, iris, coneflower, lobelia, delphinium.

Tree/Shrubs - dogwood, blueberry, linden, cherry, plum, willow.

Bees will be drawn to any areas with water such as shallow pools, mud puddles, birdbaths.

For shelter, bare ground supports "ground-nesting". Garden or crop residue provides benefits during the winter. Schedule, 'cleanup' for mid-Spring. Materials for nesting include cut plant stems, twigs, and small piles of brush.

Organic beekeeping is an intentional practice. Thus, one must read labels and become studied with detrimental chemicals to bees (e.g. pesticides, herbicides, insecticides). Options include garlic spray, essential oils (lavender, echinacea).
