# **Green Pastures Agrihoods & Benevolent Mushrooms - **_**Ganoderma**_

Green Pastures Agrihoods intentionally supports benevolent mushroom production, using the _Ganoderma_ spp.

Ganoderma lucidum is the genus and species of choice for Green Pastures Agrihoods.

_**"Ganoderma **_is a [genus ][0]of [polypore ][1]mushrooms that grow on wood, and include about 80 species, many from [tropical ][2]regions.Because of their extensive use in traditional Asian medicines, and their potential in [bioremediation][3], they are a very important genus economically. _Ganoderma _can be differentiated from other polypores because they have a double-walled [basidiospore][4]. They are popularly referred to as shelf mushrooms or [bracket fungi][5]." \[1, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma\]

_"Ganoderma _are characterized by [basidiocarps ][6]that are large, perennial, woody brackets also called "[conks][7]". They are [lignicolous ][8]and [leathery ][9]either with or without a stem. The fruit bodies typically grow in a fan-like or hoof-like form on the trunks of living or dead trees. They have double-walled, truncate [spores ][10]with yellow to brown ornamented inner layers." \[2, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma\]
