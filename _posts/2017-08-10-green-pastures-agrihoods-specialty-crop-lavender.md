Lavender is a small, aromatic shrub used in the fragrance, specialty food, and alter-native medicine industries. Although family farmers may find large-scale extraction of lavender's valuable oil too expensive and laborious, small-scale lavender production is feasible for some farmers using alternative marketing strategies. Entertainment farming has been a very successful form of alternative marketing for lavender, especially as a focus for annual festivals and product sales.

Like most herbs, lavender has few if any insect pests. Few fungal diseases attack lavender, but since there are no known remedies for them, chemical applications are not an issue. Lavender ranks high as a sustainable crop because it does not rely on pesticides and fertilizers. It does not require fertilizing, although in rare circumstances irrigation may be called for. The biggest issue is finding a viable marketing method.

_**"Lavandula angustifolia**_ (**lavender** most commonly **true lavender** or **English lavender**, though not native to England; also **garden lavender**,**common lavender**, **narrow-leaved lavender**), formerly _L. officinalis_, is a [flowering الو plants][0] in the [family][1][Lamiaceae][2], native to the Mediterranean (Spain, France, Italy, Croatia etc.).

## Growth

It is a strongly aromatic [shrub][3] growing as high as 1 to 2 metres (3.3 to 6.6 ft) tall. The leaves are [evergreen][4], 2--6 centimetres (0.79--2.36 in) long, and 4--6 millimetres (0.16--0.24 in) broad. The flowers are pinkish-purple (lavender-coloured), produced on spikes 2--8 cm (0.79--3.15 in) long at the top of slender, leafless stems 10--30 cm (3.9--11.8 in) long.

## Etymology

The [species][5] name _angustifolia_ is Latin for "narrow leaf". Previously, it was known as _Lavandula [officinalis][6]_, referring to its medicinal properties.

## Cultivation

English lavender is commonly grown as an [ornamental plant][7]. It is popular for its colourful flowers, its fragrance, and its ability to survive with low water consumption. It does not grow well in continuously damp soil and may benefit from increased drainage provided by inorganic mulches such as gravel. It does best in [Mediterranean climates][8] similar to its native habitat, characterised by wet winters and dry summers. It is fairly tolerant of low temperatures and is generally considered hardy to [USDA][9][zone 5][10].It tolerates acid soils but favours neutral to [alkaline soils][11], and in some conditions it may be short-lived."
