![Biobased product, was defined by the United States Secretary of Agriculture in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 as follows, "The term ‘‘biobased product’’ means a product determined by the Secretary to be a commercial or industrial product (other than food or feed) that is composed, in whole or in significant part, of biological products or renewable domestic agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials) or forestry materials OR an intermediate feedstock.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4ed33dfa-7bbc-4fe6-bfe2-3fdf984ac430.png)

### **"Soil Food Web"**

_Green Pastures AgriVillage_s believes in the Soil Secrets premium product line. This amazing product line reveres the "soil food web", network of ecosystems, which provides nutrient distribution for the multiple feeding levels found within Mother Earth -- the "Soil Food Web"(SFW)!

The SFW refers to an earth-based ecosystem ("community of organisms") where these biological beings live most or part of their lives in the soil (e.g. bioactivity). This is all happening below ground, containing diverse trophic or feeding systems. SFW holds symbiotic relationships with the environment, including plants and animals.

Further, there is an intricate level of bioactivity with transfers of energy, between multiple species, within a biologically based system (ecosystem).

Soil Secrets taps into the SFW:

_1) Decreases water usage!_

_2)Supports drought resistance!_

_3) Increases plant health_

_4) Increases crop production yields_

_5) Optimized "Soil Food Web" conditioning_

_6) Decreased costs long term_
![Soil Secrets LLC develops products which instigate the natural biochemical process required for healthy soils. This process is referred to as the ‘Soil Food Web’. The foundation of the Soil Secrets protocol is based on Mycorrhizal fungi and Humic substances rich in Humic Acids. Soils of urban landscapes, farms and other sites are often deficient or completely lacking in Mycorrhizae and Humic substances. Individually and combined these products provide the primary benefits we are after, which includes better nutrition for the plant, better water management for the landscape or farm and the building of soil (Pedogenesis).

### _**Applied Science of Humic Acids: TerraPro(r)**_

_**Green Pastures AgriVillages**_, with the support of Soil Secrets, uses sound science to support healthy soils. Some of this sound science includes humic acids. Humic acids are essential to the best quality, healthy, rich, and most productive soils in the world!

Humic acids offer the capacity to actually build and condition the soil's ecosystem, leading to an appearance of a very dark fertile quality. Humic acids are nature's best chelators of 'plant nutrient bioavailability', and are "...essential for a healthy and productive soil"(J. Chemical Education, 12/2001).

With 'humic acid enrichment', microbes are nurtured within the "soil food web" (SFW) creating an environment favorable for maximized root growth (root zone). Therefore, essential water and trace elements have increased bioavailability within the SFW. Plants receive improved nutrition and overall health. Healthy plants are more "nutrient dense", when filled with vitamins and minerals.

_**Green Pastures AgriVillages**_ appreciates Soil Secrets' ability to authentically honor the essential element of carbon, which is contained within soils, as humic acids. Humic acids have supramolecular capability for effectiveness in treatment for land remediation. Their ability for land remediation can counter toxins, corrosive materials, and even salty environments. This furtherimproves the SFW!

![A mycorrhiza (from Greek μ&upsi;κός mykós, "fungus", and ῥίζα rhiza, "root"; pl. mycorrhizae or mycorrhizas) is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a vascular host plant.[1] The term mycorrhiza refers to the role of the fungi in the plants' rhizosphere, its root system. Mycorrhizae play important roles in soil biology and soil chemistry.
In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM), or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi. The association is generally mutualistic, but in particular species or in particular circumstances, mycorrhizae may be variously pathogenic in the host plants.[2]](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/de543881-2307-430a-805a-632789fb4ba0.jpg)

## _**Mycorrhizal Products**_

_**Green Pastures AgriVillages**_ realizes the significance of mycorrhizal fungi for optimal and overall healthy soils! Mycorrhizal species of fungi are beneficial and essential to healthy soil components, such as the "soil food web". "Myco" refers to "mushroom", and "rhizal" refers to "related to roots".

These benevolent fungi partner with many plants and trees. Their capability involves forming "exterior sheaths" symbiotically surrounding the root system for partnered plants (ectomycorrhizae). In addition, "Mycorrhizal fungi" seek the interior of "root cells" of "host plants" (endomycorrhizae).

Soil Secrets provides the highest quality and concentration of mycorrhizal soil treatments available on the market! EndoMaxima(r), White Lightning(r), and MycoMaxima(r) offer high quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence with professional concentrated products. All products are available in large quantities.

Mycorrhizal fungi form a [mutualistic ][1]relationship with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and those parts of the roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The [Orchidaceae ][2]are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds

**Mycorrhizal Fungal Benefits of Soil Secrets:**

* _Builds topsoil for sequestering of essential carbon!_
* _Increased crop yields!_
* _Improved drought tolerance; sustainability!_
* _Improved mineral nutrient uptake!_
* _Improved food nutrient density!_
* _Protects roots from damaging nematodes!_
* _Improved ability to tolerate environmental stressors!_
* _Increased profitability!_
![Protein Crumblies® is nature’s best source of nutritional calories for feeding the soil. Derived from selected vegetable proteins, Soil Secrets has selected this product for the best ratios of amino acids that can provide the highest protein efficiency value possible. 

Soil Microorganisms are part of the ‘Soil Food Web’ and Protein Crumblies can provide these microorganisms a high quality protein with the highest percent nitrogen per unit of protein. This product has a crude protein content providing a source of slow release organic nitrogen. The nitrogen can become part of the Soil Food Web once totally liberated by the action of the primary, secondary, and tertiary decomposers (soil microorganisms), and many plants can uptake the amino acids derived from this protein as part of their nitrogen budget.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/af03cb4f-9f4e-4e3f-ae9c-b8fdca7f2ee9.jpg)
