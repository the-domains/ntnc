## **"Soil Food Web"**

Green Pastures Agrihoods believes in the Soil Secrets premium product line. This amazing product line reveres the "soil food web", network of ecosystems, which provides nutrient distribution for the multiple feeding levels found within Mother Earth -- the "Soil Food Web"(SFW)!

The SFW refers to an earth-based ecosystem ("community of organisms") where these biological beings live most or part of their lives in the soil (e.g. bioactivity). This is all happening below ground, containing diverse trophic or feeding systems. SFW holds symbiotic relationships with the environment, including plants and animals.

Further, there is an intricate level of bioactivity with transfers of energy, between multiple species, within a biologically based system (ecosystem).

Soil Secrets taps into the SFW:

* _Decreases water usage!_
* _Supports drought resistance!_
* _Increases plant health_
* _Increases crop production yields_
* _Optimized "Soil Food Web"_
* _Long term decrease in costs_

## Applied Science of Humic Acids: TerraPro(r)

Green Pastures Agrihoods, with the support of Soil Secrets, uses sound science to support healthy soils. Some of this sound science includes humic acids. Humic acids are essential to the best quality, healthy, rich, and most productive soils in the world!

Humic acids offer the capacity to actually build and condition the soil's ecosystem, leading to an appearance of a very dark fertile quality. Humic acids are nature's best chelators of 'plant nutrient bioavailability', and are "...essential for a healthy and productive soil"(J. Chemical Education, 12/2001).

With 'humic acid enrichment', microbes are nurtured within the "soil food web" (SFW) creating an environment favorable for maximized root growth (root zone). Therefore, essential water and trace elements have increased bioavailability within the SFW. Plants receive improved nutrition and overall health. Healthy plants are more "nutrient dense", when filled with vitamins and minerals.

Green Pastures Agrihoods appreciates Soil Secrets' ability to authentically honor the essential element of carbon, which is contained within soils, as humic acids. Humic acids have supramolecular capability for effectiveness in treatment for land remediation. Their ability for land remediation can counter toxins, corrosive materials, and even salty environments. This furtherimproves the SFW!

### Soil Secrets Benefits:

* _Improves nutrient uptake!_
* _Improves "SFW" structure &amp; root development!_
* _Increases beneficial microbes!_
* _Increases crop yield production!_
* _Retains nourishment; holds water better!_
* _Minimizes runoff & potential for drought!_
* _Improves fertility!_
* _Remediates damage by crude oil, salt; mine tailing by removing heavy metals from water/soil!_

### Applied science for society with Soil Secrets:

* _Agri-Enterprises_
* _Landscapes_
* _Construction_
* _Parks & Recreation_
* _Land Rehabilitation & Restoration_

### _**Healthy Soil = Healthy Food = Healthy Beings**_

Green Pastures Agrihoods offers this simple equation to educate citizens as to the necessity of understanding and supporting the "soil food web"! It is with great joy for Green Pastures Agrihoods to feature Soil Secrets.

This phenomenal premium product line realizes that the element of nitrogen is an essential ingredient of the "soil food web"! Soil microbes and plants live in a symbiotic relationship that requires nitrogen.

Nitrogen is a building block of amino acids, and, amino acids are the building blocks of protein! Supplying the "soil food web" with easily accessible and quality protein nutrients, such as Protein Crumblies(r) that contain "essential amino acids", optimally nourishes the soil's ecosystem in our precious earth! With optimal nourishing comes optimal flourishing!

### TerraPro of Soil Secrets:

* Provides amino acids containing essential Nitrogen element!
* Improves plant's nutritional value!
* Improves environmental sustainability
* Increases crop yields!
* Increases monetary revenue!

## _**Mycorrhizal Products**_

Green Pastures Agrihoods realizes the significance of mycorrhizal fungi for optimal and overall healthy soils! Mycorrhizal species of fungi are beneficial and essential to healthy soil components, such as the "soil food web". "Myco" refers to "mushroom", and "rhizal" refers to "related to roots".

These benevolent fungi partner with many plants and trees. Their capability involves forming "exterior sheaths" symbiotically surrounding the root system for partnered plants (ectomycorrhizae). In addition, "Mycorrhizal fungi" seek the interior of "root cells" of "host plants" (endomycorrhizae).

Soil Secrets provides the highest quality and concentration of mycorrhizal soil treatments available on the market! EndoMaxima(r), White Lightning(r), and MycoMaxima(r) offer high quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence with professional concentrated products. All products are available in large quantities.

**Mycorrhizal Fungal Benefits of Soil Secrets:**

* _Builds topsoil for sequestering of essential carbon!_
* _Increases crop yields!_
* _Improves drought tolerance &amp; sustainability!_
* _Improves mineral nutrient uptake!_
* _Improves food nutrient density!_
* _Protects roots from damaging nematodes!_
* _Improves ability to tolerate environmental stressors!_
* _Increases profitability!_
