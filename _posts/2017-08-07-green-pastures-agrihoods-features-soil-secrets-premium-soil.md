![Biobased product, was defined by the United States Secretary of Agriculture in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 as follows, "The term ‘‘biobased product’’ means a product determined by the Secretary to be a commercial or industrial product (other than food or feed) that is composed, in whole or in significant part, of biological products or renewable domestic agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials) or forestry materials OR an intermediate feedstock (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4ed33dfa-7bbc-4fe6-bfe2-3fdf984ac430.png)

### **"Soil Food Web"**

_Green Pastures AgriVillage_s believes in the Soil Secrets premium product line. This amazing product line reveres the "soil food web", network of ecosystems, which provides nutrient distribution for the multiple feeding levels found within Mother Earth -- the "Soil Food Web"(SFW)!

The SFW refers to an earth-based ecosystem ("community of organisms") where these biological beings live most or part of their lives in the soil (e.g. bioactivity). This is all happening below ground, containing diverse trophic or feeding systems. SFW holds symbiotic relationships with the environment, including plants and animals.

Further, there is an intricate level of bioactivity with transfers of energy, between multiple species, within a biologically based system (ecosystem).

### _**Soil Secrets taps into the SFW:**_

_1) Decreases water usage!_

_2)Supports drought resistance!_

_3) Increases plant health_

_4) Increases crop production yields_

_5) Optimized "Soil Food Web" conditioning_

_6) Decreased costs long term_
![Soil Secrets LLC develops products which instigate the natural biochemical process required for healthy soils. This process is referred to as the ‘Soil Food Web’. The foundation of the Soil Secrets protocol is based on Mycorrhizal fungi and Humic substances rich in Humic Acids. Soils of urban landscapes, farms and other sites are often deficient or completely lacking in Mycorrhizae and Humic substances. Individually and combined these products provide the primary benefits we are after, which includes better nutrition for the plant, better water management for the landscape or farm and the building of soil (Pedogenesis).

### _**Applied Science of Humic Acids: TerraPro(r)**_

_**Green Pastures AgriVillages**_, with the support of Soil Secrets, uses sound science to support healthy soils. Some of this sound science includes humic acids. Humic acids are essential to the best quality, healthy, rich, and most productive soils in the world!

Humic acids offer the capacity to actually build and condition the soil's ecosystem, leading to an appearance of a very dark fertile quality. Humic acids are nature's best chelators of 'plant nutrient bioavailability', and are "...essential for a healthy and productive soil"(J. Chemical Education, 12/2001).

With 'humic acid enrichment', microbes are nurtured within the "soil food web" (SFW) creating an environment favorable for maximized root growth (root zone). Therefore, essential water and trace elements have increased bioavailability within the SFW. Plants receive improved nutrition and overall health. Healthy plants are more "nutrient dense", when filled with vitamins and minerals.

_**Green Pastures AgriVillages**_ appreciates Soil Secrets' ability to authentically honor the essential element of carbon, which is contained within soils, as humic acids. Humic acids have supramolecular capability for effectiveness in treatment for land remediation. Their ability for land remediation can counter toxins, corrosive materials, and even salty environments. This furtherimproves the SFW!

## _**Soil Secrets Benefits:**_

* _Improves nutrient uptake!_
* _Improves "SFW" structure &amp; root development!_
* _Increases beneficial microbes!_
* _Increases crop yield production!_

![A mycorrhiza (from Greek μ&upsi;κός mykós, "fungus", and ῥίζα rhiza, "root"; pl. mycorrhizae or mycorrhizas) is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a vascular host plant.[1] The term mycorrhiza refers to the role of the fungi in the plants' rhizosphere, its root system. Mycorrhizae play important roles in soil biology and soil chemistry.
In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM), or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi. The association is generally mutualistic, but in particular species or in particular circumstances, mycorrhizae may be variously pathogenic in the host plants (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/de543881-2307-430a-805a-632789fb4ba0.jpg)

## _**Mycorrhizal Products**_

_**Green Pastures AgriVillages**_ realizes the significance of mycorrhizal fungi for optimal and overall healthy soils! Mycorrhizal species of fungi are beneficial and essential to healthy soil components, such as the "soil food web". "Myco" refers to "mushroom", and "rhizal" refers to "related to roots".

These benevolent fungi partner with many plants and trees. Their capability involves forming "exterior sheaths" symbiotically surrounding the root system for partnered plants (ectomycorrhizae). In addition, "Mycorrhizal fungi" seek the interior of "root cells" of "host plants" (endomycorrhizae).

Soil Secrets provides the highest quality and concentration of mycorrhizal soil treatments available on the market! EndoMaxima(r), White Lightning(r), and MycoMaxima(r) offer high quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence with professional concentrated products. All products are available in large quantities.

Mycorrhizal fungi form a [mutualistic ][1]relationship with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and those parts of the roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The [Orchidaceae ][2]are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds.

**Mycorrhizal Fungal Benefits of Soil Secrets:**

* _Builds topsoil for sequestering of essential carbon!_
* _Increased crop yields!_
* _Improved drought tolerance; sustainability!_
* _Improved mineral nutrient uptake!_
* _Improved food nutrient density!_
* _Protects roots from damaging nematodes!_
* _Improved ability to tolerate environmental stressors!_
* _Increased profitability!_
![Protein Crumblies® is nature’s best source of nutritional calories for feeding the soil. Derived from selected vegetable proteins, Soil Secrets has selected this product for the best ratios of amino acids that can provide the highest protein efficiency value possible. 

Soil Microorganisms are part of the ‘Soil Food Web’ and Protein Crumblies can provide these microorganisms a high quality protein with the highest percent nitrogen per unit of protein. This product has a crude protein content providing a source of slow release organic nitrogen. The nitrogen can become part of the Soil Food Web once totally liberated by the action of the primary, secondary, and tertiary decomposers (soil microorganisms), and many plants can uptake the amino acids derived from this protein as part of their nitrogen budget (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/af03cb4f-9f4e-4e3f-ae9c-b8fdca7f2ee9.jpg)
![TREE AND SHRUB CARE – FIRST SEASON

Summer Watering

A newly planted tree should be watered approximately once every 2-4 days by soaking the tree canopy drip zone using a sprinkler or due to area or budget constraints by filling a water basin. Optimum Tree Growth will occur if you mulch the tree canopy drip zone or basin with organics or wood chips to a depth of 4 to 6 inches, leaving a bare 4-inch to 6 inch area directly around the trunk. (The ideal tree planting site is a mulched site, with a radius of 20 feet which is the potential reach of a small tree roots during the first growing season. Soak this zone once per week until the soil is saturated.)

If you have any doubts then check the soils moisture content. Push aside the mulch, and grab a handful of soil. If it is soaking wet then decrease water.  If your soil is just moist to dry, then it is time to water (Acct#-483 715 for orders).

### _**Feeding or Fertilizing**_

The Soil Secrets products, _Earth Magic_ / _Protein Crumblies_, may be applied anytime, normally twice annually. These products inoculate your soil with beneficial soil bacteria and mycorrhizae fungi, and much needed Humus and provide plant available mineral nutrients. The beneficial mycorrhizae fungi help plants acquire water and nutrients making your landscape stronger and more drought tolerant in the long run. Humus -- humus and more humus. _Earth Magic_ is humus and there is no toxicity point to humus. If your soils are awful and you are in doubt use more than the label rate. Nothing else can do what humus and mycorrhizae do!!!!

_TTP Supreme Compost_ can also be used, as it is a great organic form of nutrients that remain available to plants in the soil for a greater time than inorganic sources of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Many of these inorganic sources are water soluble and are carried deeper into the soil and away from the roots with each watering. It is best to avoid chemical fertilizers for this reason. Compost feeding can be done by direct application to the mulch beds around plants and then thoroughly watered in. All fertilizers chemical or organic need to be used properly as too much of even a good thing like our _TTP Supreme Compost_ can cause burn and can cause plants to lose their relationship with the mycorrhizae. Feed with compost twice annually, in spring and fall.
![Winter Watering

As trees go dormant (deciduous trees lose leaves) decrease watering frequency from 7 to 14 to 21 day intervals. Water when able in the winter (i.e. when the ground is not frozen). Young trees / shrubs must be watered during the winter to prevent the root ball from drying out which may result in death of your tree. Winter watering should be done approximately once every 3-4 weeks by soaking the tree canopy drip zone using a sprinkler or by filling the watering basin.  Make sure the plant is not soaking in wet mud all winter long which can cause rot. Moist soils not wet are the rule (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab8469a5-f1a1-4df5-838e-bc0b3a87a4e0.jpg)
![Pruning

Resist the urge to prune and shape during the first season unless there are dead or misshapen branches. Leaving these branches on the plant helps to support growth of new roots and shoots. Pruning can be done during dormancy after the first growing season or anytime (season) thereafter. Winter pruning often increases vigor (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/16f6d2e4-fa08-4067-a203-f08889bfbb0d.jpg)
![Earth Nectar®: A super drink for the soil!   There’s no question about it, microbes rule. They run all the major chemical cycles on earth by making enzymes that serve as catalysts to many of the important chemical reactions in the soil. 

Earth Nectar is a broad spectrum of soil based enzymes made by microbes. This product also contains TTP Supreme Compost, whole kelp, humus, and plant extracts, each dissolved into a rich nectar for the soil. Earth Nectar and Earth Ambrosia can be blended together in equal amounts, diluted with water and sprayed onto the soil as a drench. Do Not Use more than 1 gallon of either product per 1000 sq. ft. of application (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7f341dc0-b26a-404e-a7ee-580796f356f1.jpg)
![TTP Supreme Compost®: 100% wholesome ingredients.  If made with quality ingredients and tight quality controls, compost can be an excellent source of organic nutrients. Never use a compost product without first examining the analysis of the product to see if it meets your needs. TTPSupreme Compost is a nutrient dense product that’s been triple screened, providing a clean and fine particle size product, that’s also clean enough to be used in hydroseeding equipment. City bio-solids (human waste) are not allowed in this product, which helps us guarantee you that disease contamination is minimized. This product has been tested by Western Labs for soil disease and has consistently tested clean and free of those risks. This product is nutrient dense and needs to be used sparingly, as a little goes a long way! A full assay of tests showing maturity, stability, Humic Acids, organic matter, nitrogen, major and minor nutrients, and carbon to nitrogen ratio is available upon request by emailing us as info@soilsecrets.com (Acct#-483 715 for orders).](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/70856763-d95b-4a9a-b19f-71da27c31a1d.jpg)
