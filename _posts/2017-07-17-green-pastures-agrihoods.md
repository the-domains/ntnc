* After processing the stems, two materials are produced; hurds and fibres.
* Both hurds and fibres have properties that make them useful in building construction. (HempBuilding.com)

* This hempcrete is cast around a framework.
* This is achieved by [tamping down][0] between shuttering, or it can be sprayed against a formwork (permanent or temporary).
* Internally a variety of finishes are possible. In this example the framework has been left exposed and the hempcrete finished with a natural paint. (HempBuilding.com

"Hempcrete in twelve inch thick sections has an R-value...of twenty (20\#)." \[1, _HempBound_ by Doug Fine, p,33-34\] Hemp insulation "takes less" energy, and will "keep a house heated to seventy degrees Fahrenheit (70 F/21 C)". \[2, _HempBound_ by Doug Fine, p,33-34\]

Hempcrete is "easy to apply on-site..., is caste around a" framework of support. \[3, HempBound by Doug Fine, p,33-34\]
