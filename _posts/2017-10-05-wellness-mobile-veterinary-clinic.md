# _**WELLNESS MOBILE VETERINARY CLINIC**_
![Wholistic veterinary methods refer to those which are applied with the entire being (e.g. Human, Animal) as the priority
consideration.
Integrative veterinary methods refer all ancient wisdom medicine and healing techniques of indigenous cultures (e.g.
Traditional Chinese Medicine/TCM) and current traditional medicinal techniques (e.g. surgery in western medicine).
As a veterinarian who practices with a context of “Wholistic Integrative”, it is appropriate to share the significance of the
health of the healer. Healers must learn how to not only ‘heal self’, but also maintain optimal overall health and
wellness. Embracing the understanding of being a healer includes being a teacher. Teacher is the underlying context of
which the understanding of “physician” rose. Uphold the ‘healer-teacher’ mindset, and employ a minimum of three (3#)
spiritual techniques or disciplines by which one embraces the mindfulness of becoming ‘one who heals’!](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0b9c7d44-1114-48ac-9280-f0d3425454e3.png)

## _**Wholistic Integrative Energy-Based Veterinary Medicine**_

1)_Ayuvedic Veterinary Medicine_

The earliest information on the art of caring for animals in India is provided by the sacred texts of the Vedic religion. These texts, written between 1500 and 600 BC, were transmitted orally from generation to generation, over the centuries, before being written down. The oldest Vedic literature consists of collections of hymns, liturgical chants and sacrificial or magical formulae, mainly in verse, which constitute the Veda proper (1500-1000 BC).

2) _Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) -- Chi Institute; International Veterinary Acupuncture Society_

Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM), although relatively new to the Western world, is a medical system used in China to treat animals for thousands of years.  It is an adaptation and extension of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat humans.  Speaking broadly, Chinese Medicine is a complete body of thought and practice grounded in Chinese Daoist philosophy.  Though it can be traced back over two millennia in recorded history, it, like any medical system, continues to evolve today, and current research on acupuncture and herbal medicine is beginning to shed light on its mechanism of action.

3) _'Nutri-Nourishment' is minimally 90% of overall health and wellness! (_VETERINARY FORMULAS (tm) Standard Process)

Standard Process holds a line of Veterinary Formulas that are vital to wholistic veterinary medical practice. At this time in our collective evolution, both humans and animals must supplement due to the commercialized, mechanized, monetized, and industrialized approach to food/animal production. Mother Earth's soils have been depleted. 'Nutri-nourishment' is essential to survive as well as thrive!

Muscle Response Testing is a technique which allows for clients to be a surrogate for their animals to survey the body in order to ask the 'physical body temple' what is needed and where from a nutritional standpoint.
