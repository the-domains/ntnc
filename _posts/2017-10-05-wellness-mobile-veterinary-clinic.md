  Wholistic veterinary methods refer to those which are applied with the entire
  being (e.g. Human, Animal) as the priority

  consideration.

  Integrative veterinary methods refer all ancient wisdom medicine and healing
  techniques of indigenous cultures (e.g.

  Traditional Chinese Medicine/TCM) and current traditional medicinal techniques
  (e.g. surgery in western medicine).

  As a veterinarian who practices with a context of “Wholistic Integrative”, it
  is appropriate to share the significance of the

  health of the healer. Healers must learn how to not only ‘heal self’, but also
  maintain optimal overall health and

  wellness. Embracing the understanding of being a healer includes being a
  teacher. Teacher is the underlying context of

  which the understanding of “physician” rose. Uphold the ‘healer-teacher’
  mindset, and employ a minimum of three (3#)

  spiritual techniques or disciplines by which one embraces the mindfulness of
  becoming ‘one who heals’!
