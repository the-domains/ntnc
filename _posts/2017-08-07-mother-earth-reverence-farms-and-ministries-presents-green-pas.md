# _**Mother Earth Reverence Farms & Ministries presents Green Pastures AgriVillages!**_
![Honoring her continual rebirthing!](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/20d59fb2e0100e359d7bb09337bcfb0e983bb77a.jpg)

**Mother Earth Reverence Farms & Ministries** (MERF) is a 'clearinghouse' midwifing, companioning, championing, and modeling a consortium of earth-friendly, 'accessible best practices' for the 21st century global village as "Agrihoods".

Midwifery translates from indigenous ancient wisdom, honoring of the planet -- Mother Oceania Earth, and an appreciation of birth (rebirth). These farms are focused on 'accessible best practices' in agri-stewardship enterprise, sustainable living, herd health management, small ruminant animal production, specialty crops (e.g. lavender, _Ganoderma_, industrial hemp), wholistic integrative veterinary medicine, enrichment of the "soil food web", green building systems, and 'creative covenantal beloved community' development.

**MERF's** sacred cause is to align with Mother Oceania Earth's beings-human, animal, plant, elements in benevolent vibration with 'All That Is' divine-sacred-holy. Agrihoods are 'agriculturally-based', self-reliant neighborhoods (e.g. villages, communities, municipalities).

**Calling **(Vision): **MERF **is in sacred service to midwife healing and energetic balance with Mother Earth & all her relational beings to revolutionarily and 'ohmnibenevolently' transform the 21st century global village!

**Cause **(Mission): **MERF **honors intentional, 'authentic servant leadership' in modeling earth-friendly, transformative, & simple best practices in agri-stewardship & sustainable living to revolutionarily transform the 21st century global village!

**Destiny **(Purpose): **MERF **models harmonic balance with a local geographical focus to encourage, companion, and champion 'agrihoods'!

**MERF **continues the legacy of Dr. George Washington Carver who revolutionized American agriculture in the 20th century. Carver's revolutionary approach is a context for sustainability and self-reliance.
