Hall expands King's "The Beloved Community" by infusing a 21st century twist, in adding the modifier's, 'creative' & 'covenantal' with 'Creative Covenantal Beloved Community'. In the 21st century global village, 'creative' or creativity is vital!

For Green Pastures Agrihoods, 'creative' includes criteria of innovative, accessible, simple, and sustainable! Zero waste and zero debt does require a creative approach, which will translate into community/self-reliance. 'Creative Covenantal Beloved Community' is manifested with the five pillars for Green Pastures Agrihoods and Hemphoods

Covenantal (adjective), or pertaining to the covenant (noun), literally refers to "an agreement, bargain; a sealed contract or clause as such a contract" to enter into a formal agreement (The New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of the English Language, Lexicon Publishing INC., New York, 1989 Edition). With Green Pastures Agrihoods, a covenant is necessary to assure the ultimate health and overall well being of the collective! This covenant primarily involves a commitment to consensus. Pertaining to the covenant of Green Pastures Agrihoods, the design hold intention surrounding the expression of 'agape love' is through _consensus_. King modeled an 'authentic loveservant leadership' in the Freedom Movement of the 20th century. This is the humanitarian and theological perspective of Green Pastures Agrihoods.

_Consensus_ is absolutely vital to augment the vitality of 'Creative Covenantal Beloved Community'! Consensus incorporates supreme validity, when mutuality of all stakeholders have 'honored voice'. Therefore, each 'honored voice' will be represented and heard. Everyone must agree. If agreement does not manifest, then it may be an opportunity to pause, for the greater good. Further, with consensus, no one is left outside of the circle.

### _Beloved Community_

"The Beloved Community" is a term first coined in the early days of the 20th Century by the philosopher-theologian Josiah Royce, who founded the Fellowship of Reconciliation. However, it was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., also a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, who popularized the term and invested it with a deeper meaning. This deeper meaning has captured the imagination of people of goodwill all over the world.

For Dr. King, The Beloved Community was not a lofty utopian goal to be confused with the rapturous image of the Peaceable Kingdom, in which lions and lambs coexist in idyllic harmony. Rather, The Beloved Community was for him a realistic, achievable goal that could be attained by a critical mass of people committed to and trained in the philosophy and methods of nonviolence.

Dr. King's Beloved Community is a global vision, in which all people can share in the wealth of the earth. In the Beloved Community, poverty, hunger and homelessness will not be tolerated because international standards of human decency will not allow it. Racism and all forms of discrimination, bigotry and prejudice will be replaced by an all-inclusive spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood. In the Beloved Community, international disputes will be resolved by peaceful conflict-resolution and reconciliation of adversaries, instead of military power. Love and trust will triumph over fear and hatred. Peace with justice will prevail over war and military conflict.

Dr. King's Beloved Community was not devoid of interpersonal, group or international conflict. Instead he recognized that conflict was an inevitable part of human experience. But he believed that conflicts could be resolved peacefully and adversaries could be reconciled through a mutual, determined commitment to nonviolence. No conflict, he believed, need erupt in violence. And all conflicts in The Beloved Community should end with reconciliation of adversaries cooperating together in a spirit of friendship and goodwill.

As early as 1956, Dr. King spoke of The Beloved Community as the end goal of nonviolent boycotts. As he said in a speech at a victory rally following the announcement of a favorable U.S. Supreme Court Decision desegregating the seats on Montgomery's busses, "the end is reconciliation; the end is redemption; the end is the creation of the Beloved Community. It is this type of spirit and this type of love that can transform opponents into friends. It is this type of understanding goodwill that will transform the deep gloom of the old age into the exuberant gladness of the new age. It is this love which will bring about miracles in the hearts of men."

Sustainable Agriculture & Self-Reliance

**"George Washington Carver** (1860s[\[2\]][1][\[3\]][2] -- January 5, 1943), was an American [botanist][3] and inventor. The exact day and year of his birth are unknown; he was born into slavery in [Missouri][4], either in 1861, or January 1864\.[\[3\]][2]

Carver's reputation is largely based on his promotion of alternative crops to cotton, such as [peanuts][5] and [sweet potatoes][6]. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts. He spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts; none were commercially successful.[\[4\]][7] He was also a leader in promoting [environmentalism][8].[\[5\]][9] He received numerous honors for his work, including the [Spingarn Medal][10] of the [NAACP][11].

In an era of very high racial polarization, his fame reached beyond the black community. He was widely recognized and praised in the white community for his many achievements and talents. In 1941, _[Time][12]_ magazine dubbed Carver a "Black [Leonardo][13]".[\[6\]][14]

Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of [cotton][15]. Together with other agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore [nitrogen][16] to their soils by practicing systematic [crop rotation][17]: alternating cotton crops with plantings of [sweet potatoes][6] or [legumes][18] (such as [peanuts][5], [soybeans][19] and [cowpeas][20]). These crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption. Following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops. To train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops, Carver developed an agricultural extension program for Alabama that was similar to the one at Iowa State. To encourage better nutrition in the South, he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops.

In addition, he founded an industrial research laboratory, where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them. They did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others. Carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins.

Peanut specimen collected by Carver

Carver's work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure. President [Theodore Roosevelt][21] publicly admired his work. Former professors of Carver's from Iowa State University were appointed to positions as Secretary of Agriculture: [James Wilson][22], a former dean and professor of Carver's, served from 1897 to 1913\. [Henry Cantwell Wallace][23] served from 1921 to 1924\. He knew Carver personally because his son [Henry A. Wallace][24] and the researcher were friends.[\[29\]][25] The younger Wallace served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from 1933 to 1940, and as [Franklin Delano Roosevelt][26]'s vice president from 1941 to 1945\.

The American industrialist, farmer, and inventor [William Edenborn][27] of [Winn Parish][28], [Louisiana][29], grew peanuts on his demonstration farm. He consulted with Carver.[\[30\]][30]

In 1916 Carver was made a member of the [Royal Society of Arts][31] in England, one of only a handful of Americans at that time to receive this honor. Carver's promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice. In 1919, Carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk. Both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in 1917 William Melhuish had secured [US 1243855][32], issued 1917-10-23for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeans.\[_[improper synthesis?][33]_\]

The United Peanut Associations of America invited Carver to speak at their 1920 convention. He discussed "The Possibilities of the Peanut" and exhibited 145 peanut products. By 1920, the U.S. peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the [Republic of China][34].

In 1921 peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at Congressional hearings to ask for a [tariff][35]. Based on the quality of Carver's presentation at their convention, they asked the African-American professor to testify on the tariff issue before the [Ways and Means Committee][36] of the [United States House of Representatives][37]. Due to [segregation][38], it was highly unusual for an African American to appear as an expert witness at Congress representing European-American industry and farmers. Southern congressmen, reportedly shocked at Carver's arriving to testify, were said to have mocked him.\[_[citation needed][39]_\] As he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for American agriculture, the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony. The [Fordney-McCumber Tariff][40] of 1922 was passed including one on imported peanuts. Carver's testifying to Congress made him widely known as a public figure" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_Washington\_Carver).
