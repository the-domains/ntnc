### **MORINGA**
![BOTANIC DESCRIPTION Moringa oleifera is a small, graceful, deciduous tree with sparse foliage, often resembling a leguminous species at a distance, especially when in flower, but immediately recognized when in fruit. The tree grows to 8 m high and 60 cm dbh.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3ade840f-e2d9-44a6-843e-2a7ebf41a9f4.jpg)

**Moringa** (_Moringa oleifera_Lam.) is a multipurpose tropical tree. It is mainly used for food and has numerous industrial, medicinal and agricultural uses, including animal feeding. Nutritious, fast-growing and drought-tolerant, this traditional plant was rediscovered in the 1990s and its cultivation has since become increasingly popular in Asia and Africa, where it is among the most economically valuable crops. It has been dubbed the "miracle tree" or "tree of life" by the media ([FAO, 2014][0];[Radovich, 2009][1];[Orwa et al., 2009][2];[Bosch, 2004][3]).

**What is BeeFriendly(tm)?**BeeFriendly(tm) is a Host Defense(r) initiative to help reverse the devastating declines in the global bee population that are critically threatening the world's food security.

**Why do bees need help? **In 2015, Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) rates increased 6% to affect **41%** of managed bee colonies nationwide. Some scientists estimate that all managed bee colonies could face total decimation by CCD within five years. Although CCD is not fully understood, it appears to be a destructive synergism of multiple factors. Pathogen (bacterial & viral) infection harms bees already challenged by other stress factors: parasitic mites, pesticides, fungicides and GMO exposure. These stressors of infection, parasitism, toxins, and immune deficits/depression may initiate CCD.

**Why Host Defense?**  
Bees need comprehensive immune support to combat the diseases, parasites, and toxins that are driving their decline. Supporting Host Defense means supporting bee recovery research and development.
