  BEMER: BEMER stands for Bio Electro-Magnetic Energy Regulation
   “Electromagnetic energy is known as the oldest form of energy in the universe. Since
  the beginning, nature has produced this form of energy as the basis for the
  proper

  functioning of all organisms.” Peter Gleim, president of Inomad International

### Where is BEMER made and what are the certifications?

### The BEMER is manufactured in Liechtenstein and has been on the market for over 10
years. It is sold in 42 countries world wide. In Europe, the BEMER has a highly
respected certification in its classification as a Medical Device IIA. There have been no
complaints of negative side effects of the BEMER reported to the governing World
Health Organization who set the European guidelines for public exposure to electro
magnetic frequencies.
The BEMER corporation in America was recently awarded an IRB \# by the FDA. It is
the only company in the US that has been given this number, allowing medical doctors in
the U.S. To use the device in their practice and bill the insurance companies.
