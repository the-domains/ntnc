Goat milk has many attributes for self-reliant agrihoods! The milk is known to be universally accepted for humans and pet animal companions in need of ‘nutri-nourishment’ in order to assist with a thriving newborn. </p>,<p>One moderately producing milk doe is quite enough to support a family of four. Regarding dairy production, the Nubian breed is most optimal!</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/857eb89b-8921-40fd-9581-2d6c1688ea27.jpg">,<p><strong>Green Pastures Agrihoods</strong> holds top breeding pairs of the Kiko meat goat. In reference to meat production, the Kiko breed is most optimal animal. In order to implement effective, efficient, &amp; excellent outcomes, goats provide the features in the ‘agrihood prototype’ that is duplicatable in most locations. These animals are hardy, and the ability to apply animal husbandry is simple to manage for women and children!</p>,<p>The choice for goat production is completely intentional. It is possible to create a doubling of a herd within a year’s time, for the pregnancy timeframe is 4 months, where twins are usually borne!</p>,<p>Chevron or ‘goat meat’ is the mostly consumed meat product in the world!</p>,<p><strong>Green Pastures Agrihoods</strong> promotes and supports the implementation of caprine production.

This premium product line meets the benchmark of the <em>USDA National Organic Program</em> (NOP), and are available for use on organic certified farms.</p>,<p>Urban gardens and lawns may safely access <strong>Soil Secrets</strong> products for optimal plant and sod health! Rest assured that these plant-derived, organic treatment essentials actually serve Mother Earth, her “soil food web”, and any plants or crops grown!</p>,<p>Benefits of Soil Secrets:</p>,<ul><li>Improved water drought tolerance for crop production!</li><li>Improved water storage in soil!</li><li>Optimal efficiency of photosynthesis!</li><li>Improved nutrient exchange!</li><li>Optimized local “soil food web”!</li></ul>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4ed33dfa-7bbc-4fe6-bfe2-3fdf984ac430.png">,<h2><strong>“Soil Food Web”</strong></h2>,<p>Green Pastures Agrihoods believes in the Soil Secrets premium product line. This amazing product line reveres the “soil food web”, network of ecosystems, which provides nutrient distribution for the multiple feeding levels found within Mother Earth – the “Soil Food Web”(SFW)!</p>,<p>The SFW refers to an earth-based ecosystem (“community of organisms”) where these biological beings live most or part of their lives in the soil (e.g. bioactivity). This is all happening below ground, containing diverse trophic or feeding systems. SFW holds symbiotic relationships with the environment, including plants and animals.</p>,<p>Further, there is an intricate level of bioactivity with transfers of energy, between multiple species, within a biologically based system (ecosystem).</p>,<p>Soil Secrets taps into the SFW:</p>,<ul><li>Decreases water usage!</li><li>Supports drought resistance!</li><li>Increases plant health</li><li>Increases crop production yields</li><li>Optimized “Soil Food Web”</li><li>Long term decrease in costs</li></ul>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b20ebb4b-3596-4cc4-931f-a79d9b42b5d7.bmp">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b171c28-b78c-4de3-97af-9d22292eb451.jpg">,<h2>Applied Science of Humic Acids: TerraPro®</h2>,<p>Green Pastures Agrihoods, with the support of Soil Secrets, uses sound science to support healthy soils. Some of this sound science includes humic acids. Humic acids are essential to the best quality, healthy, rich, and most productive soils in the world!</p>,<p>Humic acids offer the capacity to actually build and condition the soil’s ecosystem, leading to an appearance of a very dark fertile quality. Humic acids are nature’s best chelators of ‘plant nutrient bioavailability’, and are “…essential for a healthy and productive soil”(J. Chemical Education, 12/2001).</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fe48a62a-d303-4ccc-b688-2a022a82c40f.jpg">,<p>With ‘humic acid enrichment’, microbes are nurtured within the “soil food web” (SFW) creating an environment favorable for maximized root growth (root zone). Therefore, essential water and trace elements have increased bioavailability within the SFW. Plants receive improved nutrition and overall health. Healthy plants are more “nutrient dense”, when filled with vitamins and minerals.</p>,<p>Green Pastures Agrihoods appreciates Soil Secrets’ ability to authentically honor the essential element of carbon, which is contained within soils, as humic acids. Humic acids have supramolecular capability for effectiveness in treatment for land remediation. Their ability for land remediation can counter toxins, corrosive materials, and even salty environments. This furtherimproves the SFW!</p>,<h3>Soil Secrets Benefits:</h3>,<ul><li>Improves nutrient uptake!</li><li>Improves “SFW” structure &amp;amp; root development!</li><li>Increases beneficial microbes!</li><li>Increases crop yield production!</li><li>Retains nourishment; holds water better!</li><li>Minimizes runoff &amp; potential for drought!</li><li>Improves fertility!</li><li>Remediates damage by crude oil, salt; mine tailing by removing heavy metals from water/soil!</li></ul>,<h3>Applied science for society with Soil Secrets:</h3>,<ul><li>Agri-Enterprise</li><li>Landscapes</li><li>Construction</li><li>Parks &amp; Recreation</li><li>Land Rehabilitation &amp; Restoration</li><li>Bio-remediation</li></ul>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a40b13eb3d54779fe9bca6727e5f7d8b66e153cb.jpg">,<p>Healthy Soil = Healthy Food = Healthy Beings</p>,<p>Green Pastures Agrihoods offers this simple equation to educate citizens as to the necessity of understanding and supporting the “soil food web”! It is with great joy for Green Pastures Agrihoods to feature Soil Secrets.</p>,<p>This phenomenal premium product line realizes that the element of nitrogen is an essential ingredient of the “soil food web”! Soil microbes and plants live in a symbiotic relationship that requires nitrogen.</p>,<p>Nitrogen is a building block of amino acids, and, amino acids are the building blocks of protein! Supplying the “soil food web” with easily accessible and quality protein nutrients, such as Protein Crumblies® that contain “essential amino acids”, optimally nourishes the soil’s ecosystem in our precious earth! With optimal nourishing comes optimal flourishing!</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4216d020-e00e-47c6-a208-01f3d832f79e.jpg">,<h3>TerraPro of Soil Secrets:</h3>,<ul><li>Provides amino acids containing essential Nitrogen element!</li><li>Improves plant’s nutritional value!</li><li>Improves environmental sustainability</li><li>Increases crop yields!</li><li>Increases monetary revenue!</li></ul>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/de543881-2307-430a-805a-632789fb4ba0.jpg">,<h2><em><strong>Mycorrhizal Products</strong></em></h2>,<p>Green Pastures Agrihoods realizes the significance of mycorrhizal fungi for optimal and overall healthy soils! Mycorrhizal species of fungi are beneficial and essential to healthy soil components, such as the “soil food web”. “Myco” refers to “mushroom”, and “rhizal” refers to “related to roots”.</p>,<p>These benevolent fungi partner with many plants and trees. Their capability involves forming “exterior sheaths” symbiotically surrounding the root system for partnered plants (ectomycorrhizae). In addition, “Mycorrhizal fungi” seek the interior of “root cells” of “host plants” (endomycorrhizae).</p>,<p>Soil Secrets provides the highest quality and concentration of mycorrhizal soil treatments available on the market! EndoMaxima®, White Lightning®, and MycoMaxima® offer high quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence with professional concentrated products. All products are available in large quantities.</p>,<p>Mycorrhizal Fungal Benefits of Soil Secrets:</p>,<ul><li>Builds topsoil for sequestering of essential carbon!</li><li>Increases crop yields!</li><li>Improves drought tolerance &amp;amp; sustainability!</li><li>Improves mineral nutrient uptake!</li><li>Improves food nutrient density!</li><li>Protects roots from damaging nematodes!</li><li>Improves ability to tolerate environmental stressors!</li><li>Increases profitability!</li></ul>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/af03cb4f-9f4e-4e3f-ae9c-b8fdca7f2ee9.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7e5713e4055dc89064ca436d38eb5be6fa91c034.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab8469a5-f1a1-4df5-838e-bc0b3a87a4e0.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/16f6d2e4-fa08-4067-a203-f08889bfbb0d.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7f341dc0-b26a-404e-a7ee-580796f356f1.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/70856763-d95b-4a9a-b19f-71da27c31a1d.jpg">]]></description>

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr." alt="From Agape International Spiritual Center">,<p>Hall expands King’s “The Beloved Community” by infusing a 21st century twist, in adding the modifier’s, ‘creative’ &amp; ‘covenantal’ with ‘Creative Covenantal Beloved Community’. In the 21st century global village, ‘creative’ or creativity is vital! </p>,<p>For Green Pastures Agrihoods, ‘creative’ includes criteria of innovative, accessible, simple, and sustainable! Zero waste and zero debt does require a creative approach, which will translate into community/self-reliance. 'Creative Covenantal Beloved Community' is manifested with the five pillars for Green Pastures Agrihoods and Hemphoods</p>,<p>Covenantal (adjective), or pertaining to the covenant (noun), literally refers to  “an agreement, bargain; a sealed contract or clause as such a contract” to enter into a formal agreement (The New Lexicon Webster’s Dictionary of the English Language, Lexicon Publishing INC., New York, 1989 Edition). With Green Pastures Agrihoods, a covenant is necessary to assure the ultimate health and overall well being of the collective! This covenant primarily involves a commitment to consensus. Pertaining to the covenant of Green Pastures Agrihoods, the design hold intention surrounding the expression of ‘agape love’ is through <em>consensus</em>. King modeled an ‘authentic loveservant leadership’ in the Freedom Movement of the 20th century. This is the humanitarian and theological perspective of Green Pastures Agrihoods.</p>,<p><em>Consensus</em> is absolutely vital to augment the vitality of ‘Creative  Covenantal Beloved Community’! Consensus incorporates supreme validity, when mutuality of all stakeholders have ‘honored voice’. Therefore, each ‘honored voice’ will be represented and heard. Everyone must agree. If agreement does not manifest, then it may be an opportunity to pause, for the greater good. Further, with consensus, no one is left outside of the circle.</p>,<h3><em>Beloved Community</em></h3>,<p>“The Beloved Community” is a term first coined in the early days of the 20th Century by the philosopher-theologian Josiah Royce, who founded the Fellowship of Reconciliation. However, it was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., also a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, who popularized the term and invested it with a deeper meaning. This deeper meaning has captured the imagination of people of goodwill all over the world.</p>,<p>For Dr. King, The Beloved Community was not a lofty utopian goal to be confused with the rapturous image of the Peaceable Kingdom, in which lions and lambs coexist in idyllic harmony. Rather, The Beloved Community was for him a realistic, achievable goal that could be attained by a critical mass of people committed to and trained in the philosophy and methods of nonviolence.</p>,<p>Dr. King’s Beloved Community is a global vision, in which all people can share in the wealth of the earth. In the Beloved Community, poverty, hunger and homelessness will not be tolerated because international standards of human decency will not allow it. Racism and all forms of discrimination, bigotry and prejudice will be replaced by an all-inclusive spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood. In the Beloved Community, international disputes will be resolved by peaceful conflict-resolution and reconciliation of adversaries, instead of military power. Love and trust will triumph over fear and hatred. Peace with justice will prevail over war and military conflict.</p>,<p>Dr. King’s Beloved Community was not devoid of interpersonal, group or international conflict. Instead he recognized that conflict was an inevitable part of human experience. But he believed that conflicts could be resolved peacefully and adversaries could be reconciled through a mutual, determined commitment to nonviolence. No conflict, he believed, need erupt in violence. And all conflicts in The Beloved Community should end with reconciliation of adversaries cooperating together in a spirit of friendship and goodwill.</p>,<p>As early as 1956, Dr. King spoke of The Beloved Community as the end goal of nonviolent boycotts. As he said in a speech at a victory rally following the announcement of a favorable U.S. Supreme Court Decision desegregating the seats on Montgomery’s busses, “the end is reconciliation; the end is redemption; the end is the creation of the Beloved Community. It is this type of spirit and this type of love that can transform opponents into friends. It is this type of understanding goodwill that will transform the deep gloom of the old age into the exuberant gladness of the new age. It is this love which will bring about miracles in the hearts of men.”</p>,<p>Sustainable Agriculture &amp; Self-Reliance</p>]]></description>
